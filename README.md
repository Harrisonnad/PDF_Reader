# PDF_Reader

PDF_Reader is a Python script to make audiobooks out of pdf files. The inspiration behind this project was on my comute to work I wanted to listen to audiobooks. And honestly who wants to pay for audiobooks. So here we are.

To use my program you must first download the latest release. Using powershell run the exe file with .\audiobook.exe Reader AudioStart {page_number}

*page_number represents the page you would like to start reading your pdf file
